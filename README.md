## Rules

### Steps to Start the Game:

Shuffle the Deck: Thoroughly shuffle the deck of UNO cards.

Deal the Cards: Each player is dealt 7 cards, one at a time. The remaining cards form the draw pile, which is placed face down in the center of the table.

Starting the Discard Pile: Turn over the top card from the draw pile and place it face up next to the draw pile to start the discard pile.

If the card is a Wild or Wild Draw Four card, shuffle it back into the deck and draw another card.
If the card is an action card (e.g., Reverse, Skip, Draw Two), the first player must follow that action.
Decide Who Goes First: Typically, the player to the left of the dealer goes first, and play continues in a clockwise direction.

### Playing the Game:

On their turn, each player must match a card from their hand with the top card on the discard pile by color, number, or symbol.
If they cannot make a match, they must draw a card from the draw pile.
If the drawn card can be played, the player can play it immediately. If not, their turn ends.
Each player gets 7 cards.
